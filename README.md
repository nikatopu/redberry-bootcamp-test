# Test for Redberry Bootcamp

This is just a React Front-End app working with Redberry API, made under 10 days. The codebase is a bit messy, since I haven't touched React in 2 years.

The API used in this project: https://api.real-estate-manager.redberryinternship.ge/swagger

The Figma design by Redberry: https://www.figma.com/design/vrHgurPtLY1xILfbizb2ks/Bootcamp---wireframes?node-id=46029-3315&node-type=canvas&t=4rMzt6Z2lde8KT6b-0

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
